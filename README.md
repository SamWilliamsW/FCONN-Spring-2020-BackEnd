# FCONN_Backend
* This is the Node, Express backend that connects to the MongoDB for the FCONN project.
* You will need access to the MongoDB database.
* Reach out to me at lucasdale99@gmail.com in order to be added to the MongoDB Organization. 
* I will then pass it on to whomever takes up the project and leave the database in your hands.
